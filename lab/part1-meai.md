# Microsoft Extensions for AI (MEAI) Fundamentals

## In this lab

In this lab, you will learn about Microsoft Extensions for AI (MEAI), a new set of libraries and tools that make it easier to build AI applications in .NET. You'll understand the key components and concepts that form the foundation of AI development with .NET.

## Understanding MEAI

Microsoft Extensions for AI provides a consistent programming model and a set of common components for building AI applications in .NET.

## Key Components

- **Text Generation**: Tools for generating text using large language models
- **Embeddings**: Converting text into numerical vectors for semantic search
- **Prompts**: Template system for structuring inputs to AI models
- **Function Calling**: Enabling models to call functions and APIs

## Common Patterns

Learn the common patterns for interacting with AI services and models in your .NET applications.

## Next Steps

Once you understand the fundamentals of MEAI, proceed to [Exploring the Codebase & Building the Products Feature](./part2-exploring-codebase.md) to see how these concepts are implemented in our sample application.
