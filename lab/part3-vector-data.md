# Vector Data and Embeddings

## In this lab

In this lab, you will learn about vector data and embeddings, which are core concepts in modern AI applications. You'll understand how text is converted into numerical vectors that can be used for semantic search and similarity matching.

## Understanding Vector Embeddings

Learn what vector embeddings are and how they represent the semantic meaning of text in a numerical format.

## Qdrant Vector Database

Explore how the Qdrant vector database is used in the application to store and query embeddings.

## Working with PDF Data

See how the application processes PDF documents to extract text and create embeddings for semantic search.

## Implementing Semantic Search

Understand how semantic search is implemented using vector embeddings to find relevant information.

## Next Steps

After learning about vector data and embeddings, continue to [Using GitHub Models](part4-github-models.md) to discover how to integrate GitHub's AI models into your application.
