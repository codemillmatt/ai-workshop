   - Explain `[McpServerTool]` and `[Description]` attributes
   - Walk through `GetCurrentWeather` implementation
   - Discuss JSON serialization patterns

3. **Build and Validate** (5 minutes)
   - Run `dotnet build` to verify compilation
   - Address any build issues or questions

#### **VS Code Integration (10 minutes)**

1. **MCP Configuration** - Create `.vscode/mcp.json`
2. **Server Registration** - Add WeatherMcpServer configuration

### Common Student Questions

**Q: "Why not just use APIs directly in the AI chat app?"**
A: MCP makes tools reusable across any AI agent (Copilot, Claude, etc.) and provides standard protocols for tool discovery and execution.

**Q: "Do I need real weather APIs?"**
A: No, Part 7 uses simulated data to focus on MCP concepts. Real APIs can be added later.

**Q: "What if my tools don't appear in Copilot?"**
A: Check tool descriptions are clear, VS Code MCP configuration is correct, and GitHub Copilot extensions are active.

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Build Errors:**

- Verify .NET 10 SDK installation
- Check `ModelContextProtocol` package version
- Clear NuGet cache: `dotnet nuget locals all --clear`

**MCP Integration Issues:**

- Restart VS Code after configuration changes
- Verify `.vscode/mcp.json` syntax and paths
- Check VS Code Output panel for MCP-specific errors
